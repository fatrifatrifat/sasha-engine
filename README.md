# Sasha Engine

Sasha Engine is a personal project designed to deepen my understanding of **DirectX 12** while building a modular graphics engine. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with modern graphics programming techniques and prepare for an upcoming internship focused on game development and real-time rendering.

## Features

- Basic Rendering Pipeline: Implements core DirectX 12 features such as command lists, resource management, and GPU synchronization.
- Shader Management: Supports loading and compiling vertex and pixel shaders.
- Scene Management: Includes basic scene rendering with objects, textures, and materials.
- Modular Architecture: The engine is divided into distinct modules (core, renderer, input, utility) to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Development Goals

This project aims to cover a variety of graphics techniques including:

- Lighting Models
- Texture Mapping
- Blending and Stenciling
- Advanced Shader Stages: Including geometry, compute, and tessellation shaders.

## Purpose

This project is part of my effort to improve my understanding of **DirectX 12** and graphics programming. I am focusing on learning the inner workings of the DirectX API, particularly for my internship, where I will apply this knowledge in a professional environment.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/fatrifatrifat/sasha-engine.git`
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
3. Build the project using **x64 Debug/Release** configuration.

## Contributing

This project is not open for contributions at this time, but feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or ask questions about specific parts of the engine.
